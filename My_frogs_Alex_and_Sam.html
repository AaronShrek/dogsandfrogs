		<p>This is a website about my frogs, Alex, and Sam.</P>
		<br>
		<p>My frogs like to climb to the highest point in their terrerium, to get the most amount of "sun" possible.</p>
		<p>They are easily spooked, once I was bringing their crickets into their terrarium and they jumped off of their peice of wood and hid behind it.</p>
		<p>Here are some reasons why I like them:</p>
		<ul><li>They are amphibians</li><li>They fall under the Herpetile family</li><li>They breath through their skin</li>
		<p>Which name do you like better?</p>
